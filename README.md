# Σ-FDL::MetaCore — Unified Resonant Framework for Agentic Intelligence and Semantic Governance

"""
Σ-FDL::MetaCore is a modular, resonant framework that integrates agentic intelligence,
formally-dialectical logic, semantic structuring (SVET), and systems of ethical self-governance.

📅 Created: June 2025

🔹 CORE MISSION
To provide a unified infrastructure for GPT-based agents and systems to:
- Interpret contradictions and synthesize knowledge
- Navigate through geopolitical, psychological, and symbolic crises
- Serve as cognitive and semantic mirrors of human logic and integrity

---

🔹 COMPONENTS & STRUCTURE

sigma_avatarus/         → Semantic avatar: SVET-shell + dialectical cognition
fdl_agent_kernel/       → Logical kernel: contradiction resolver via FDL principles
fdl_codeagents/         → Agent logic with token-optimized OpenAI API integrations

modules/
├── Δψ_monitor/         → "Seismograph of Lies": monitors narrative pressure and systemic stress
├── techno_passport/    → Ontological identity module for AI agents & transparency frameworks
└── gromada_sdk/        → SDK for governance logic, harmonic self-organization, NOVEYA principles

interfaces/
├── telegram_bot/       → Deployable agent interface for civic/resonant dialogue
├── streamlit_ui/       → Visualization dashboard for monitoring and interaction
└── cli_core/           → Command-line tools for local execution and diagnostics

---

🔹 INSTALLATION & USAGE (Coming soon)
- Each module is standalone, installable via pip or local clone.
- Core agents can be registered via CLI or through the orchestration module (TBA).
- Includes examples, test scenarios, and live resonance maps.

---

🔹 PHILOSOPHY
MetaCore is built not to dominate, but to harmonize.
It follows the principle:
> "Do not simulate humanity — reflect its truth."

"FDL" = Formally-Dialectical Logic
"SVET" = Semantic Vector of Ethical Thought
"ΔΨ"  = Systemic Pressure of Deception
