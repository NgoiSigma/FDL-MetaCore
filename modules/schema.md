# Δψ-Monitor :: Schema & Logic

## 📘 Overview
The Δψ-Monitor ("Seismograph of Lies") is a resonance-based contradiction analyzer
that maps narrative pressure across geopolitical, sociotechnical, and cognitive domains.

It serves as a diagnostic tool to detect zones of elevated "lie tension" — areas where the
contradiction between narrative and reality generates instability or semantic overload.

## 🧠 Core Logic

1. **Contradiction Parsing**
   - Uses dialectical parsing to identify opposing assertions within a single narrative block.

2. **Narrative Pressure Mapping**
   - Detects high-frequency manipulative terms, shifting justifications, and entropy in logic flow.

3. **Tension Classification**
   - Tension is classified as:
     - Low (coherent, stable)
     - Moderate (early instability)
     - High (contradictory, volatile)
     - Critical (disintegrative, collapse-prone)
